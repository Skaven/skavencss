# Skaven.css 📜

Skaven.css is a lightweight, drop-in CSS framework designed to give your web projects a unique, old-school, skeuomorphic aesthetic. It transforms standard HTML into a tactile, paper-like interface, perfect for RPG journals, personal blogs, or retro-styled documentation.

To use Skaven.css immediately, just add this line to the head of your HTML file:

## Usage Guide

### 1. Basic Typography
Skaven.css automatically styles headings, paragraphs, and quotes to look like they were printed in a vintage manual. Standard tags like h1, h2, p, and blockquote are already styled.

### 2. Buttons
Add the .btn class to any button or link to give it a tactile, clickable look:
<a href="#" class="btn">Click Me</a>

### 3. Cards & Containers
To group content inside a paper-style container, use the .card class:
<div class="card">Your content here</div>

### 4. Form Elements
Input fields, textareas, and select menus are styled to blend perfectly with the parchment background. Simply use standard input or textarea tags.

### 5. Navigation
Create a simple navigation bar using a nav tag with the .nav class and a standard list.

## Customization

You can easily override the default variables if you want to change the parchment color or font intensity by editing the :root values in your own CSS:

:root {
    --bg-color: #e8d5b5; 
    --text-color: #1a1a1a;
}
